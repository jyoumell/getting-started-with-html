<h1>Stage 0: Getting Started with HTML</h1>

<h2>How the Web Works</h2>
<p>
Through a computer (and broswer), a user will send a <em>HTTP request</em> to a <em>server</em>. 
At that point, an HTML document is rendered on the user's machine. The web is made up of billions 
of these interconnected pages. 
</p>
<p>HTML is <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> made up of <b>text content</b> (what you see) and 
<b>markup</b> (what it looks like). HTML can contain references to other documents (like images and videos) 
and links to other pages.
  Take a look at <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48230539/m-48742046">this
  video</a> for more detail.
</p>

<h2>Tags & Elements</h2>
<p><b>Elements</b> are larger categorizations that contain HTML <b>tags</b>, which tell the broswer how we 
would like to render the content within our HTML code. 
</p>

<h2>Types of Elements</h2>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form a box around the content within the tag, which is not visible on a website. 
  Block elements can also contain attributes like width and height.
</p>
<p><b>Void tags</b> hold no content and have no "closeout" tags. Examples are image or break tags. For example: <br>
<img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/pXxnDpPZHXnKqBqwvI4cmhsztuM23lbmy0o5zVEZTfXQR69u5Nlx7hfxcCOGZP_Yp_3HwpK3zVAtXejMAg=s0"
